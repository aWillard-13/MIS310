This folder is a collection of upgraded project we worked on during MIS310, 
Cont Business Applications Development I Class, in the Spring semester of 2025.

DO NOT USE ANY OF MY PROGRAMS WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT PERMISSIONS.

CalculatorApp - 
  This is an upgraded version of the calculator app we made in class
  with keyboard button inputs. most the letters have been disabled other than the "C" for 
  the "clear" function. Proper operator functioning (when the user presses enter, then 
  presses a number, it clears out the entry first.

DiceApp -
  Based on the use of the Dice game (with the use of random lib).
  a GUI has been added. a button to roll dice.
  the ability to add or subtract the number of dice rolls has been implemented.
  the scope has changed.
  the type of dice has been expanded on with the introduction of the concept of 
  "I am making this for DND dice now."
  the dice are now tracked in a dnd like fashion "#d#". the first being the count of dice, 
  the second being the number of sides.
  7 dice types have been added.
  the ability to increase and decrease each die with the mouse scroll wheel has been added.
  error handling added.
  custom darkmode pop out windows added.
  when the #d# of a die is clicked, a pop up window where the person can type in the desired number
  of dice of that type.

Humidity Checker - 
  we have replaced the gardener with automation (this is a joke).
  This program is a string of instructions on what microproccessors and sensors to buy,
  in order to automatio this process. Because this is a python class, we programmed it accordingly.

Magic Date Checker - uses the tkcalendar lib to bring the GUI to life.
  (there is an invisible button that randomly selects a magic date to see it working).

Roman Numeral Convertor - 
  Instead of being limited by 1-10, 
  this converter can get past the M and right on to the overline

Unit Conversion App - 
  This code is an expansion on the unit conversion program.
  I added a GUI, various units to convert to / from.
  Then I expanded upon the various types of measurement.
  added tabs to swap between the measurement types.
  implemented pandas and notebooks to switch the units. 
    (liked this more than the dropdown or radio buttons)
  Added the scroll wheel function that I have implemented so many times before.

State Capitol Quiz
  This is an expantion on the quiz that asks the user what the capitol of a state is,
  based on dictionary list of states and their capitols.
  I added a GUI, added a hint button, changed the game mode to a mulitple choice...
  then added a 50/50 option when the hint is pressed. 
  the game mode can be switched back to the text input mode, ttk was implemented to make the arrow.

Patient Manager -
  information Interface
  I have to stop. the Scope keeps moving. we are done. I have to be done.
  This is a code that pulls and pushes patient information from various .json files.
  based off the first code we worked on in class:
      I expanded on the idea by making the code store the information in a .json...
      Created a GUI that references this information...
      Broke out the json into 3 different files.
      added 3 different tabs, scaled it back and removed the tkcalendar (it worked but it was too much)
      deleted 1 tab. made both tabs semi usable.
      
  future:
      need to add error handling and records with issues.
      need to add an admin tab that breaks down every json file and it's contents for easy editing and updating.
      add doc profiles?
      bring back the schedulerTab.
      not 100% happy with the colors. not to difficult of a fix, 
      just need to do breakout variables like I have done before.
