This folder is a collection of upgraded project we worked on during MIS310, 
Cont Business Applications Development I Class, in the Spring semester of 2025.

CalculatorApp - This is an upgraded version of the calculator app we made in class
with keyboard button inputs. most the letters have been disabled other than the "C" for 
the "clear" function. Proper operator functioning (when the user presses enter, then 
presses a number, it clears out the entry first.

DiceApp - Based on the use of the Dice game (with the use of random lib).
a GUI has been added. a button to roll dice.
the ability to add or subtract the number of dice rolls has been implemented.
the scope has changed.
the type of dice has been expanded on with the introduction of the concept of 
"I am making this for DND dice now."
the dice are now tracked in a dnd like fashion "#d#". the first being the count of dice, 
the second being the number of sides.
7 dice types have been added.
the ability to increase and decrease each die with the mouse scroll wheel has been added.
error handling added.
custom darkmode pop out windows added.
when the #d# of a die is clicked, a pop up window where the person can type in the desired number
of dice of that type.

Humidity Checker - we have replaced the gardener with automation (this is a joke).

Magic Date Checker - uses the tkcalendar lib to bring the GUI to life.
(there is an invisible button that randomly selects a magic date to see it working).

Roman Numeral Convertor - instead of being limited by 1-10, 
this converter can get past the M and right on to the overline
