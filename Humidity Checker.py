"""
base logic is:
if the humidity is below 40%, turn on the high-intensity misting system, waits 3 minutes, checks the humidity again.
If the humidity is  40% - 50%, turn on the low-intensity misting system, waits 3 minutes, checks the humidity again.
If the humidity above 50%, waits 10 minutes, checks the humidity again.
